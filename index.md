<!-- Hello reader! I am a first year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Princeton University. Through this webpage, I intend to showcase some of my past and on-going projects. If you find any of this stuff exciting and would like to know more, feel free to shoot me an email! -->

<!-- My research interests include integrated circuits and systems, wireline communication, computer architecture and machine learning. -->
<!-- 
I graduated from [Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) in August 2022 with BTech and MTech degrees. During my time at IIT Bombay, I worked with [Prof. Rajesh Zele](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~zelerajesh/index.php) in Advanced Integrated Circuits and System Lab (aiCAS).
