Hello reader! My name is **Mihir Kavishwar**. I am a senior undergraduate in the [Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web), pursuing a Dual Degree (BTech + MTech) with a specialization in Microelectronics and VLSI Design.  

My research interests include **Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits for Edge AI**, **Energy-Efficient Hardware Accelerators** and **High-Speed Serial Links**. I am currently working with [Prof. Rajesh Zele](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~zelerajesh/index.php) in **Advanced Integrated Circuits and System Lab (aiCAS)** at IIT Bombay. Through this webpage, I intend to showcase some of my past and on-going projects. If find any of this stuff exciting and would like to know more, feel free to shoot me an email! 

You can find a summary of my projects in my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/pdfs/Mihir_Kavishwar_Academic_CV.pdf). For more details, check out the [Projects]({{site.url}}/projects) section. 

## Updates
- **October 2021**: Completed my Dual Degree Project (Master's Thesis) Stage 1 Presentation. Report and presentation slides can be found in the [Projects]({{site.url}}/projects) section.
- **July 2021**: Completed a summer internship at [Ceremorphic India Pvt. Ltd.](https://ceremorphic.com/) and have been offered full-time employment in their Analog Design team.

VLSI stands for Very Large Scale Integration, which refers to the process of integrating billions of transistors in an elegant fashion on to a tiny microchip. From mobile phones and laptops to automobiles and spacecrafts, almost every modern technology is enabled by these semiconductor chips. My research interest lies in a specific area of VLSI known as <b>Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI Design</b>. I am especially fascinated by applications of Analog and Mixed-Signal circuits in resource constrained Edge devices, Machine Learning accelerators and Neuromorphic hardware.

<!-- Over the last few decades, the semiconductor industry has been large governed by [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and we have seen exponential increase in computing power of microprocessors. However, it seems that we are reaching a point where shrinking transistor sizes further would be extremely difficult due to fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, the -->
