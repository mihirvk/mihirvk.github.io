### Why this blog post <a name="why"></a>

1. To save myself the trouble of repeating the whole story and answering the same questions every time someone asks
2. To help future graduate school applicants make more informed decisions
3. To assure any well wishers that I’m happy, healthy and more motivated than ever before

### Background <a name="background"></a>

Princeton’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), unlike most other universities, doesn’t admit PhD students directly into research groups. They instead have an advisor matching process after the first semester where students submit advisor preferences and the professors decide who they want to recruit in their labs (ref: [ECE Graduate Student Handbook](https://ece.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf1836/files/documents/22-23%20Handbook_8_24_22.pdf), page 7). 

### What happened <a name="what"></a>

The professor I was hoping to work with at Princeton decided not to take me in his group. This was mainly due to an important new responsibility that he has taken up which requires a lot of his time and effort and made him extremely cautious about bringing in new students. The primary reason why I had applied to Princeton was my interest in working with this professor - I had indicated the same in my statement of purpose (SoP) and our conversations had been highly positive both during my admission interview and the open house. But at the end of the winter break he told me his final decision of being unable to take me in due to certain constraints.

I spent a lot of time considering my other options and meeting different professors. Two other professors that I was open to working with had recruited the maximum number of students they wanted to recruit as per their admission plans and didn’t have the funding for more or didn’t think I was a great fit to justify stretching their funding further. The admission yield rate for engineering PhD at Princeton was at a 10-year high for my cohort (ref: [Princeton Graduate Admission Statistics](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/about/program-metrics/admission-statistics))), which probably contributed to this situation. There was a significant research field mismatch or advising style mismatch with every other professor who did have a research opening and probably would have taken me in, so I decided not to pursue their groups. 

Both these factors - research field and advising style, were important to me since I had to make a 5 year commitment and the group would also shape my life beyond. I was willing to be flexible on the former factor. The prerequisite to pursue any PhD is willingness to learn new things and I was open to diving into other areas but not at the cost of completely giving up my core interest - the very thing that was motivating me to pursue a PhD in the first place. I decided I would rather give up Princeton.To stay and commit to a group I’m not highly motivated to work with just because I had already spent a year doing coursework, would be falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy.

Last year when I was deciding which university to join for my graduate studies, I had narrowed it down to two places that had accepted me - Princeton University and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Both universities had a professor that I was highly interested in working with. I had finally decided to go with Princeton purely based on secondary factors like stipend amount (Princeton had offered me the [Gordan Wu Fellowship](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support/fellowships/princeton-fellowships/gordon-wu-fellowship)), weather and overall ranking, although UIUC has a better ECE ranking and a much larger department.

Now once I decided that I didn’t want to stay at Princeton and I also didn’t want to give up the pursuit of a PhD, the next logical step was to try to transfer to a different university. I was still very interested in working with the professor at UIUC I had interacted with last year. So I reached out to him again in the middle of my second semester at Princeton. We had discussions over several weeks and incredibly he finally decided to accept my application. I got a formal offer by mid-April.

### Transfer logistics <a name="logistics"></a>

UIUC’s ECE department was considerate of my situation and allowed me to apply several months late based on this professor’s recommendation. I could import a lot of material from my previous year’s application. But I couldn’t transfer any Princeton course credits since I’m entering their direct PhD program (not MS+PhD) which doesn’t allow for credit transfer. So when I say I’m *transferring* it basically means I’m quitting Princeton and starting fresh at UIUC. The good thing though is unlike Princeton, PhD students at UIUC are expected to start research right away from the first semester while doing courses in parallel.

My SEVIS record and my F1 visa is currently linked to Princeton. The process for transferring it is fairly straightforward and luckily doesn’t require visits to any visa office, it is handled by student International Center offices from both universities. Princeton would be releasing my record after the completion of my first year enrollment period and UIUC would then be able to issue me a new I-20 document.

I also asked my advisor and the ECE department at UIUC if I could start early in Summer instead of waiting till the Fall term for which new students are typically admitted. They figured out a way to get me started early. I’ll be arriving on campus towards the end of May. 

### Reflections and personal comments <a name="reflections"></a>

#### On responsibility <a name="responsibility"></a>

I like to make my own life decisions and also take full responsibility for them. I knew all the rules and their implications when I decided to join Princeton last year. Things didn’t work out the way I had planned but I still stand by the decision I made last year. It was based on careful consideration of several factors and information I could gather to the best of my abilities. I probably would have made a different decision had I seen more evidence of how things can potentially go wrong with the advisor matching process but I don’t think it’s productive to analyze this counterfactual now.

Today, I know the risks of quitting Princeton and starting fresh at a different university. This is not something I’m doing impulsively and I’m prepared to face any consequences as they unfold. If you are a well wisher, I only ask that you trust me to solve my own problems if and when they present themselves, instead of worrying about if I made the right call.

Since I have traversed a path that most graduate students don’t have to, I also think it is my responsibility to share my honest perspective on the advisor matching process at Princeton ECE for the benefit of future applicants / students. I’ve done this below. 

#### On transparency <a name="transparency"></a>

This section is specifically meant for future Princeton ECE graduate school applicants.

I’ll start off by saying that the graduate student representatives have already raised the issue of advisor matching with the concerned authorities. The department hosts a biannual town hall meeting where graduate students can openly discuss their concerns with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Head of the Department, in the presence of graduate student representatives. I participated in the Spring town hall which was hosted just 2 weeks ago. There was a long discussion about advisor matching - not focused on my particular case but the process in general. Some recommendations were proposed to improve the existing process and further discussions were promised. I hope the authorities can help prevent something like my case from happening again in the future either by making better admission decisions or implementing some of the proposed improvements. 

Having said that, there is no guarantee that a student won’t land in a similar situation as I did. **During admissions, the department’s incentive is to convince all offer recipients to accept their offers, which is why they are inclined to only focus on the pros and gloss over the cons of this process.** It’s important that you understand both and are willing to make the necessary tradeoff based on your goals before choosing to join Princeton.

##### Pros 
1. Students’ interests do often change by the end of first semester at Princeton. It’s exactly one year after submitting their graduate school applications, which is a lot of time to learn about several new topics and research directions. Several students have successfully completed their PhDs in research areas very different from what they had mentioned in their SoPs.
2. Students get a chance to learn more about the inner workings of a group by attending group meetings and talking to current students in that group. This can be an important decision making factor before committing to a group.
3. Students are allowed to find an advisor from other departments while still being enrolled in the ECE department. This would be almost impossible to facilitate if there was a more rigid process.
4. In case a student can’t find an advisor match by the end of spring semester, the department can still support the student for an additional semester using teaching assistantship funding. 
5. Research is an unpredictable journey and one always ends up diving into areas they had never envisioned working in before. Some students have successfully switched fields in the past when they didn’t get to work with their preferred advisor and ended up being happy.

##### Cons
1. If the admission yield rate is high or if a particular research field suddenly becomes very popular, there would inevitably be more students than there are open research positions in that field. In that case some students are most certainly not going to get to work with their preferred advisor, irrespective of any discussions they had during the admissions cycle. 
2. Historical data about the fraction of students who got their first/second/third/none preferences may not be an accurate predictor for the future. Moreover, these numbers which might look harmless on paper don’t account for any mental stress that a significant number of students might have had to endure.
3. Students may have to compete for research positions AFTER they have been admitted to Princeton. This can not only be extremely stressful but can also lead to unhealthy relations among peers. Having a close-knit community is one of the core strengths of Princeton graduate school and making students compete for research positions AFTER they are already in Princeton seriously undermines it.
4. Students can be left hanging by professors throughout the first semester, with no clear yes or no answers, and without any transparency around how they would make the recruitment decisions. This can greatly compound the stress.
5. Princeton has a much smaller ECE department compared to a lot of other universities. There aren’t many professors who work in similar research fields (with the exception of quantum: sometimes Princeton ECE feels more like a Physics department lol). If you can’t find an advisor in your research field of interest, your only option is to switch fields (or quit :p). 
6. Contrary to conventional wisdom about characteristics of a “good” SoP, there is an implicit expectation from first year students to not be committed to their research interests if they don’t get to work with their preferred advisor. One may feel pressured into switching fields against their wishes, which may lead to unfavorable long term outcomes.

##### Unsolicited advice
1. If you care about the Princeton brand more than working with any specific professor / working in a specific field for your PhD, go for it. There is a lot of interesting, state of the art research happening all around at Princeton. If you are proactive during your first semester, you’ll almost certainly find some professor who is willing to take you in.
2. If you care about being given the flexibility to change your research field completely from what you had mentioned in your SoP, there is probably no better place than Princeton who’ll give you this flexibility. Most other top universities make it difficult to switch advisors, let alone the entire research field. Here you can apply to work in laser spectroscopy and then switch to natural language processing if you find an advisor willing to take you in, there will be no judgment.
3. If there are only one or two professors you are really interested in working with, either find more professors or don’t join Princeton. I was given similar advice by my faculty advisor from IITB but I had concluded that the probability of a failed advisor match was “almost zero” based on my open house conversations and felt that Princeton was worth the risk. I’m now better informed, especially after the town hall, and would update my estimate to “low but not insignificant”. My estimate for the process being stressful for you is “very high”. 	

#### On opportunity <a name="opportunity"></a>

Not a lot of people get the opportunity to work as a fully funded graduate student at Princeton or UIUC. I recognise that and don’t take these for granted. 

I’m super excited about starting my next journey at UIUC. I already had a lot of respect for my advisor there, having followed some of his renowned works. This has only increased because he not only offered me a spot in his group again without judging me for my past decision but also went out of his way to make the transfer logistics as smooth as possible. I’ll be working hard in the coming years to keep up with what is now expected of me. If you are a friend or a colleague and you happen to see me slacking sometime in the future, feel free to call me out and remind me about this commitment. 

The two semesters I spent at Princeton were absolutely amazing - 
- Met a lot of incredibly talented people from all over the world (I have good friends in 10+ countries now)
- Learnt some cool stuff from my courses / seminars (ECE575 by Prof. Wentzlaff has officially made it to my top three courses ever taken)
- Enjoyed unlimited access to Steinway grand pianos through my piano lessons 
- Ran regularly on the lakeside towpath which is so insanely scenic
- Visited New York several times and got a taste of life on the US east coast 
- Visited UK for a conference paper presentation for which Princeton covered a small fraction of the travel expenses despite it being my undergrad work

All the professors and administrative staff I interacted with were extremely friendly and I don’t think anyone had any bad intentions. Even if I wanted to hate this university for pushing me out, I can’t - it’s a beautiful place and I’ll cherish the time I got to spend here. I didn’t have to use any of my parent’s money for the amazing experience and funnily enough, I was given a decent monthly stipend instead. Although I’m not going to contribute to the university’s research, someday, in whatever capacity possible, I promise to give back.


#### On mental health <a name="mhealth"></a>

These two words are thrown around a lot in western universities. This [article](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/02/community-social-anxiety-introvert-mental-health-hobby-solitude-comedy-tv-streaming-cable-pay) is a good example of the current state of public discourse on this topic among students. I almost always find two themes central to these conversations:
Discussions around how mental health is extremely important and why all of us should really care about it
Discussions around how the university is not doing enough to support the mental health of its students 

I think most of us already know point 1 and point 2 is a slippery slope which can lead to students demonizing the university for not giving them free Netflix as demonstrated by that article. So ultimately, in my opinion, these conversations seldom lead to anything productive. 

For someone struggling with mental health (all of us do at some point in our lives), it would probably be more helpful if there are more open conversations focused on:
Discussions around efficacy of different interventions and strategies that seem to have a high probability of leading to better mental health outcomes 
Personal anecdotes from people about their experience in dealing with mental health problems and what worked for them

I’m taking this opportunity to encourage more open conversations by sharing my experience:

People who know me well know that I rarely lose my composure. I have an extremely reliable set of coping mechanisms (journaling, long walks/runs, music, podcasts, etc), which I got to fine tune during my time at IITB, that always work for me in stressful situations. February 2023 was the first time I felt the need to go beyond this set. To stay or leave Princeton was too important of a decision for me to be made without ascertaining that my mental health was in order. 

So I did something that I had never done before - I asked for help. I reached out to the university’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS). There was an intake process after which I was assigned a counselor. I met with the counselor for three total sessions over a month. Our goal was well defined: ensure that my mental health is not affected beyond the expected anxiety and that my decision making process is being driven by reason and not emotion. It didn’t help much in managing the anxiety per se, I think my usual strategies were much more effective. But it gave me a lot of confidence to trust my own decision making process when several people were implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) telling me that even the consideration of quitting Princeton was downright crazy.

Second thing which helped, which was a pure coincidence, was my renewed focus on my physical health. I had started training for a half marathon in January, a month before getting my first advisor rejection. The events which unfolded were a further motivation to keep training because it was one of the few things in my complete control amidst a lot of uncertainty. This in turn became a positive feedback loop between physical and mental health. I ran my first half-marathon a few days ago!

Final thing which helped was being in fairly regular contact with close friends from IITB and my immediate family. Although there were several variables to consider at every step in the decision making, the existence of a few constants made the analysis much simpler.

#### On faith <a name="faith"></a>

The only reason I mention this here is because it is closely linked to mental health and my family members often bring this up during any discussions around mental health. I personally have never associated myself with any organized belief system despite many of my family members being staunch followers of a spiritual doctrine and encouraging me to embrace the same. I have several objections to committing to any such path and while I acknowledge that it can also lead to achieving good mental health, I very much prefer my own strategies. This experience didn’t change my views. But it did make me realize, with a lot of clarity, that faith was already a major contributing factor in what helped me navigate through the uncertainties. Faith not in a divine entity or an organized spiritual/religious belief system, but faith in a set of core principles which I had identified for myself which I believe eventually lead to desirable long term outcomes no matter how severe the short term difficulties.

#### On moving on <a name="moveon"></a>

My PhD research at UIUC is going to be my entire focus in the coming years and I would prefer not ruminating over how I got there. I hope to be on good professional terms with all the professors I interacted with at Princeton. As far as I’m concerned, this chapter is closed. **This blog post was written to achieve the three main objectives I listed at the start. It has detailed answers to all the questions I got from people when I shared my update with them. I wouldn’t be responding to any requests for sharing further details on this topic.**

There is a lot to celebrate, a lot to look forward to, but most importantly a lot to work on and I’m just getting started.

#### On gratitude <a name="gratitude"></a>

Grateful to:

1. Friends from IITB who reminded me that if I got accepted at UIUC again, then as per our legally binding friendship agreement, I would be required to give them another expensive treat
2. Friends at Princeton who checked up on me regularly because they were worried I might be having too much fun with my advisor-free life while they were busy slogging 
3. MTech advisor from IITB who gave me useful practical advice and happily welcomed me to the real world when all I wanted to hear was “I’m so sorry for you” for the hundredth time
4. Parents who reiterated their unconditional support and relentlessly kept insisting that “everything happens for a reason” until I had no choice but to believe them 
5. Grandparents who sadly didn’t show any respect for my decision, scolded me at length and said that I had let them down because how dare I lose some weight
6. Sister whom I only mention so that she doesn’t feel left out when in fact she didn’t pick up any of my calls because apparently “saving lives” is more important than discussing which fancy school I go to
7. Relatives in the US whom I can always count on to help me with anything even though I haven’t completely figured out how exactly we are related
Relatives in India who I’m sure will gossip about this story but will have a hard time getting the pronunciation of “Urbana-Champaign” right
8. Anyone out there who is cheering for me who I might not have interacted with in a very long time but who was happy to spend 20 mins reading through this long and pretentious life update
