**Work in progress. More content would be added soon.**

This page contains a list of instructive textbooks, video lectures, articles, and research publications relevant to my research interests. I plan to frequently update this page to include the latest advancements in the field. While the primary motivation for creating this page is to help me navigate the vast landscape of AI/ML circuits, I hope it also helps anyone looking to explore this field. **Note that the resources listed on this page are NOT my original work.**
