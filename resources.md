**Work in progress. Content would be added soon.**

This page contains a list of instructive textbooks, video lectures, articles and research publications relevant to my research interests. I plan to frequently update this page to include latest advancements in the field. While the primary motivation for compiling several resources on a single page is to help me navigate the vast landscape of new computing and intelligent sensing paradigms, I hope it also helps anyone looking explore this field. **Note that these resources are NOT my original contributions but just a collection of other peoples' work that I find interesting.**
