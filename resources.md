This page contains a list of instructive textbooks, video lectures, articles and research publications relevant to my research interests. I plan to frequently update this page to include latest advancements in the field. While the primary motivation for compiling several resources on a single page is to help me navigate the vast landscape, I hope this also helps anyone looking to explore the field. Note that the resources listed on this page are NOT my contributions but simply a collection of other people's works as evident from the citations.
