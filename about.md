Hello reader! My name is <b>Mihir Kavishwar</b>. I am a senior undergraduate in the <b>Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay</b>. I am pursuing a Dual Degree (BTech + MTech) focused in <b>Microelectronics</b>. I plan to use this platform to showcase my key projects as well as talk about all the cool stuff in technology and beyond that excites me. 
</p> 
<p> 
While I expect to touch on a diverse set of topics through my blog posts, the theme across most of them will be the same - navigating the various levels of abstraction in order to understand a complex and beautiful idea.  I hope you find the content informative and enjoyable!
