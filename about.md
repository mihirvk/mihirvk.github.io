Hello reader! My name is <b>Mihir Kavishwar</b>. I am a senior undergraduate in the <b>Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay</b>. I am pursuing a Dual Degree (BTech + MTech) focused in <b>Microelectronics and VLSI Design</b>.  
</p> 
<p>
VLSI stands for Very Large Scale Integration, which refers to the process of integrating billions of transistors in an elegant fashion on to a tiny microchip. From mobile phones and laptops to automobiles and spacecrafts, almost every modern technology is enabled by these semiconductor chips. My research interest lies in a specific area of VLSI known as <b>Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI Design</b>. I am especially fascinated by applications of Analog and Mixed-Signal circuits in resource constrained Edge devices, Machine Learning accelerators and Neuromorphic hardware.

<p>
Through this webpage, I intend to showcase some of the projects that I have either completed or am currently working on. If find any of this stuff exciting and would like to know more, feel free to shoot me an email.

<!-- Over the last few decades, the semiconductor industry has been large governed by [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) and we have seen exponential increase in computing power of microprocessors. However, it seems that we are reaching a point where shrinking transistor sizes further would be extremely difficult due to fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, the -->

While I expect to touch on a diverse set of topics in my blog posts, the theme across most of them will be the same - navigating through complex concepts and distilling out the core ideas. I hope you find the content enjoyable!
