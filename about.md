Hello reader! My name is <b>Mihir Kavishwar</b>. I am a senior undergraduate in the <b>Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay</b>. I am pursuing a Dual Degree (BTech + MTech) focused in <b>Microelectronics and VLSI Design</b>. VLSI stands for Very Large Scale Integration, which simply refers to the not so simple process of integrating billions of transistors on to a tiny chip in an elegant fashion. From mobile phones and laptops to automobiles and spacecrafts, almost every modern technology is enabled by these semiconductor chips.

While I expect to touch on a diverse set of topics in my blog posts, the theme across most of them will be the same - navigating through complex concepts and distilling out the core ideas. I hope you find the content enjoyable!
